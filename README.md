# 🧠 Brain Tumor Classification using Deep Learning

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project focuses on **automated brain tumor classification** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **Transfer Learning (VGG16, EfficientNetB3)**. It classifies MRI scans into **four categories**:
- **Glioma**
- **Meningioma**
- **Pituitary Tumor**
- **No Tumor**

🎯 **Goal:** Provide an **efficient and accurate model** for **early brain tumor detection** to assist radiologists and medical practitioners.
